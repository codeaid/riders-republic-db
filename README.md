# Riders Republic Elite Gear Database

This is a simple single page React application allowing you to view and compare
all elite gear currently available in the
[Riders Republic](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/riders-republic) game.

Simply navigate the gear categories on the left side of the page by clicking on
them and choose the available specializations at the top to compare stats of
individual gear items.

Green values represent the best stats within the current specialization whilst
the red ones represent the worst. The difference between the best and second
best values within the specialization are displayed as green tips of the
progress bars.

Values that are not yet known are displayed as question marks.

Special thanks go out to [u/Eurojo](https://www.reddit.com/user/Eurojo/) who has
compiled a [spreadsheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/RidersRepublic/comments/rc0b4p/full_elite_gear_list_with_stats_almost/)
with all the elite gear that is currently known to exist. Without him this
project wouldn't have been possible.
